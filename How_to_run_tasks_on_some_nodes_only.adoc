== How to run tasks on some nodes only

=== Only on first node in group

Check the group array

For example
[source,yaml]
----
- name: Ping first node listed in group "tower"
  ping:
  when: inventory_hostname == groups['tower'][0]
----

=== Only if node is in group

Is the host in group node_b?

[source,yaml]
----
---
- hosts:
  - node_a
  - node_b
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
  - ping:
    when: inventory_hostname in groups['node_b']
